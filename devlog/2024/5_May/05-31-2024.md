So... I don't have as much time as I used to

I'm doing door dash on my days off... otherwise working factory job

Not able to meet by monthly bills (60% is debt) lol just remnants of my dumb decisions

I started reading up on this during my breaks at work

I really want to do this from the ground up... I rememeber watching/reading something where they trained hand-written digits eg. MNIST or something

And neural nets from scratch...

I'm gonna power it up and see how big of an image I can stream

My concern is the speed too, I know the Pi isn't really an ML platform like a Jetson

I know complaining about your life isn't cool but yeah, that's my reality right now

The other side of it... I have been doing more things that I'm not comfortable with like delivering food

I really wish this Pi's wifi worked

I'm just experimenting right now with how small of an image I can take... I used the full size last time and it just barely had my hands in view... which is bad

Probably means it has to be higher up to use a smaller image

I can do some masking too to isolate my hands

I have to calibrate the IMUs as well

There are other details
