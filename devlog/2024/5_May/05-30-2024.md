So... I don't have as much time as I used to

I'm doing door dash on my days off... otherwise working factory job

Not able to meet by monthly bills (60% is debt) lol just remnants of my dumb decisions

I started reading up on this during my breaks at work

I really want to do this from the ground up... I rememeber watching/reading something where they trained hand-written digits eg. MNIST or something

And neural nets from scratch...

I'm gonna power it up and see how big of an image I can stream

My concern is the speed too, I know the Pi isn't really an ML platform like a Jetson

I know complaining about your life isn't cool but yeah, that's my reality right now

The other side of it... I have been doing more things that I'm not comfortable with like delivering food

10:24 PM

I really wish this Pi's wifi worked

I'm just experimenting right now with how small of an image I can take... I used the full size last time and it just barely had my hands in view... which is bad

Probably means it has to be higher up to use a smaller image

I can do some masking too to isolate my hands

I have to calibrate the IMUs as well

There are other details

Oh yeah one thing I was thinking about is the speed that your fingers touch the keycaps

https://patorjk.com/blog/2009/03/16/how-fast-do-your-individual-fingers-type/

Here it says 100-200ms range as a range

So that's how fast the thing has to operate to pick up the keystrokes

10 fps that's not bad...

idk maybe that's completely wrong ha

10 hz?

What I want is to have this interface like "alright type hello 10 times" and that's what you do while it records

then it is trained on that word

Which is bad/slow... but word key combos are different

Heuristics? what is that, relevant?

Damn so even cropping to the area of interest the photo is around 3645x1327

10:54 PM

Oh... so if you tilt the camera downwards it is even smaller the photo since it gets bigger (subject) nice

Now it's 3028 by 1028

2472 x 812

wtf... I reduce the size but the crop is the same weird

2000 x 650

11:06 PM

I'm at 1660x640 it's a tight crop but can see all fingers

I had a thought, the keyboard would have a desktop companion app which would show in real time the characters/words it picked up but also can show live image like to center your hands

but ideally that just shows a red/green light

11:09 PM

There must be some threshold around the 1680px where it "zooms out" if that makes sense

The camera does not behave the way I expect it to using libcamera-still

Like this

<img src="../../../devlog-images/crop-diff-05302024.JPG">

Also may be my hands not returning to the same place

I was using post it notes

Yeah there are crops I gotta look into it

11:16 PM

well it looks like I can work with the 1680x660 px resolution

installing opencv with `sudo apt install python3-opencv`
