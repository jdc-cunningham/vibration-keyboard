Mood today is not good

Just general fear of unpaid bills/non-stop calls from credit card companies, even on the weekends

Feeling guilty that I'm not working today... I should/can... I'm donating plasma but I could also door dash some hours later tonight.

I probably will just because I have to, wear long sleeve to cover the bandage

Doing some work here now, nothing amazing yet, still learning about ML/CV stuff
