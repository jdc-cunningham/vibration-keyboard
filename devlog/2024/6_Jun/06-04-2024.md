Looks like I'll have to make a basic charting websocket app to see something

I've done that before

One issue is this usb wifi thing sucks... but that'll be fixed in a few days (new Pi Zero 2 W)

ugh... not looking good so far

Need to make this chart not grow randomly based on data

That would help
