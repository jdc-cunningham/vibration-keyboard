6:46 PM

I did go ahead and buy another pi zero 2 w... $15 from pishop.us

I was so tempted to buy another but... it's $15 and it'll just sit in my bin till it's used... I have this one with the bad wifi.

I want untethered wifi is the thing

Oh man I have a day off this week nice, I will sink some time into this project

7:23 PM

Man I cannot focus today... this is the third day that I slept less than 4 hrs

9:57 PM

I did imagine myself writing some code to match frames from a video and the time/sync with IMU recordings... but I'm mentally spent right now

I'll just write as "up next" or something
